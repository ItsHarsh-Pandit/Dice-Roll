🎲 Dice Roll Simulator - Project Description
📌 Overview
The Dice Roll Simulator is a fun web-based game that simulates rolling two dice for two players. Each time the user clicks the "Roll the Dice" button, the dice roll randomly, and the winner is displayed based on the highest number. If both players get the same number, it's a draw!

🚀 Features
✅ Random Dice Roll - Generates a random number between 1 and 6 for each player.
✅ Dynamic UI Update - Dice images update dynamically based on the roll outcome.
✅ Winner Announcement - Displays the winner or a draw message.
✅ Responsive Design - Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
✅ Smooth Animations & Styling - Cool button effects and a clean UI for a great user experience.
